AUTHOR’S NOTE

Sway is a work of fiction. Among other things, it is an examination of
the way several public lives were detached from the realm of fact and
became a kind of contemporary folklore. As such, the book should not be
read as a factual account of events or as biography. While many of the
characters in the novel bear the names of actual people, they and their
actions have been imagined by the author and should be considered
products of the imagination.

Part One

“Energy is eternal delight.”

—WILLIAM BLAKE, from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell

THE HOUSES, 1969

FROM A DISTANCE, they had the demeanor of prisoner and guard. Bobby
looked down at the frayed cuffs of his shirt, pushing them back over his
wrists as he followed Charlie away from the house. His truck stood in
the sun, its fender dented, the bed enclosed by weathered wooden boards.
Beside him, Charlie looked silently ahead, his hair covering his face
and beard, his hands crossed behind his back. He was an ex-convict,
maybe fifteen years older than Bobby, but it was hard to think of him as
being any particular age. He had taken just one look at the beat-up
piano in the back of Bobby’s truck and his face had gone expressionless,
as if it disgusted him.

“We’ll take the Ford,” he said, holding out the keys to Bobby in the
flat of his palm. Then he smiled a little facetiously, a smile at
nothing, as if they both knew there were intricate layers of pretense
between them and Charlie was inviting Bobby to admit it. “Do you mind
driving?” he said. “I don’t really feel like driving right now.”

There were two men coming up the road on motorcycles, some girls walking
back from the corral, carrying empty buckets. Dogs slept in the shade
beneath the broken planking of a shed. It was an abandoned ranch. The
first time Bobby had seen the place he’d felt oddly protective of it
because it had seemed so doomed. The buildings were falling apart —
shingles missing, holes in the walls, windows covered by black garbage
bags or sometimes just left as empty frames. There were drawings
everywhere of peace signs, animals, birds. His first day there, with his
girlfriend Kitty, they had all fallen in love with his teen-idol face,
his jeans with the colored velvet patches. It was like a lot of other
places he’d been in the past two years — everywhere along the coast now
there were groups of young people with nowhere to go and no money to
spend. It was as if they were living in a fort or a tree house. They
scraped meals together out of plants they grew or things they scavenged
from the trash outside of supermarkets.

He looked back at his truck as they got into the car. The piano was
strung up with lengths of rope, a battered upright with a few deep
scratches on its side. He was a musician — that had been his plan, to be
a rock musician — but it struck him now, with Charlie there, that the
plan had become unreal somehow, that it had been diminishing so slowly
that he hadn’t noticed. Two years ago, he’d starred in an avant-garde
film about the rise of Lucifer, a kind of rock-and-roll god who seduced
the world not into peace and love but into something more brutal,
something more like ecstasy. He’d thought of it at the time as just a
stepping-stone to other ambitions, but the role had also appealed to
him, had spoken to his particular gift — “charm,” “charisma,” none of
the words captured its unpredictability, the way it was sometimes in his
grasp, sometimes not.

Yesterday, in one of the barns, he’d been looking for some twine or rope
to secure the piano to the back of his truck when he’d come across a gun
sitting in a tool chest, wrapped in a towel. Kitty had been with him —
she was hardly even a friend anymore, just another one of the girls he
would see when he was at the ranch. She watched his expression as she
pulled up the halter strap on her shirt, her face a mocking reflection
of his surprise. The gun was a revolver, the wooden grip splintered on
one side, the wood as dry and smooth as bone. When he looked back at
Kitty, his head tilted a little to the side, her eyes seemed to say, Who
do you think you are? You’re really just some good-looking fool, the
kind of boy I would have had a crush on in high school.

“Be quiet for a minute,” he said.

She looked at him, her arms crossed in front of her chest. “Cut it out,
Bobby.”

“You can stop staring at me like that. I know what you were thinking
just now.”

He brought his hand to the back of her neck and tried to kiss her. She
turned her head away at first, but he turned it back, his fingers on her
jaw. His chest was heavy, his face unsmiling. He moved away from her a
step, letting his hand slide from her neck down her back, the gun still
in his other hand, pressing against her arm. Her hair was sheared off at
different lengths, standing up in clumps. She was so small, so delicate,
that he was almost afraid, his hand on her back, feeling the flat
muscles beneath her shirt. She kept her eyes open, watching him, as he
backed her toward the table behind her, propping her up a little in his
arms. He just stood there for a while, close enough to brush his body
against hers, to feel the rise of her breasts against his rib cage. Then
he unbuttoned the front of her jeans, using just one hand, the other one
still on the gun.

“You know, you’ve been here so long you can’t even remember your own
name anymore,” he said. “I thought you were a little smarter than that.”

“I don’t really care what you think.”

“All this ‘Charlie is Christ’ bullshit. Or is it ‘Charlie’s the Devil’?
I forget.”

“My parents were strange people,” she said, leaning back, her hand on
the table. “They never really talked. They just sort of policed each
other. I never understood what they were so afraid of. What are you so
afraid of?”

The words and ideas were not exactly hers. She had become smarter than
before, but also dreamier, smarter but also absent. He thought of the
first time he’d seen her walk off with Charlie, maybe a month or two
ago, her hand in the back of his jeans, sloppy and blatant and stoned.
“Turning them out,” Charlie called it, “breaking them in.” If you
seduced them like a father with his daughter, if you scared them a
little, got inside their heads, then any kindness you did them afterward
would seem like an act of God.

He pushed his fingers down through the opening of Kitty’s fly, feeling
the rise of muscle beneath the tangled wedge of hair. She looked right
into his eyes and seemed to barely see him.

This morning, he’d found her in the kitchen, washing dishes in the
ragged slip she sometimes wore as a dress, her nose and the skin around
her mouth burned red by the sun. She was all forearms and shins,
barefoot on the dirty kitchen floor, even smaller than he’d remembered.

“You just need to leave me alone for a little while,” she’d said.

He thought of her hips rising toward him in the barn, the freckles on
her rib cage reminding him somehow that she was sixteen, a girl from a
house with a swimming pool in Brentwood. He told her that he was going
to take the used piano over to his friend Gary’s place, pick up the
twenty dollars profit, use the money to buy some motorcycle parts. He
asked her if she wanted to come along. He spoke in a purposeful voice,
as if nothing had happened between them, but she just smiled at him in a
disbelieving way, as if she knew that Charlie was about to walk in and
say that he and Bobby needed to go have a talk.

He got in the Ford with Charlie and they headed south toward Los
Angeles, listening to a faint scratch of music on the radio, not
speaking. The rocks outside were gray, the plants a grayish green, the
dirt tan. Everything was the color of dust, except the sky, which was a
washed-out blue behind a thin yellow haze. At the little store outside
of Chatsworth, they pulled over and Charlie bought a six-pack of beer
and some things for the girls: a booklet of find-the-word puzzles, some
candy bars.

Bobby started the car and backed up, looking over his shoulder. When
they got on the highway, Charlie lit a joint, examining its smoke as it
leached out the cracked window. He passed it over, his hand low, down by
Bobby’s knee.

“You’re kind of quiet,” he said.

“I’m not quiet, I’m just wondering where we’re going.”

“We’re going to a friend of mine’s house. It’s nice there, peaceful.
You’ll like it.”

They were on Highway 118, heading toward Topanga Canyon. They drove for
a while, looking at the sparse houses surrounded by trees — oaks,
sycamores, a few tall eucalyptuses. After the hills, they came
eventually into the suburbs: gas stations, coffee shops, a movie
theater.

“I always thought you were a nice kid,” Charlie said. “But I guess maybe
there’s more to you than that. Like maybe you weren’t just bullshitting
me about the time you spent in that reform school, for example.”

Bobby looked ahead at the road. “This is about Kitty, isn’t it?” he
said. “Whatever Kitty told you.”
